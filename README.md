# MATLAB Fall 2016 – Research Plan

> * Group Name: DOSE
> * Group participants names: Davide Bernardoni, Enea Masina, Oliver Moral, Sara Pensotti
> * Project Title: The Gotthard Pass

## General Introduction

We are interested in this project because it is a reality close to our home: we live on the other side of the Gottardo pass and every time we wish to visit the Swiss-German part we have to travel thru the tunnel or in the summer months we can use the pass. Along this road segment, especially during the summer months when many take vacation. In addition to the already exponentially growing traffic, the roads have to be renewed and this is currently the case with the Gotthard pass road. Instead of completely closing the road, they have decided to leave only one lane open for both directions of traffic meaning that the road constantly has intermittent traffic and there can be several traffic congestions. In the last few years the Gotthard connection between south and north has become an especially important mean of communication not only for our nation but also for Europe. With this project we hope to find a solution to represent the current situation on the Gotthard pass. 

## The Model

The model itself is based on the data we received from ASTRA (Das Bundesamt für Strassen, The Federal Roads Office). These data slots are divided into type of vehicle, direction of travel, and date (dd/mm/yyy/hh/mm). We will utilise a model that has been studied by past students last year and we will try to utilise it for our situation. We will try to improve this model to describe the real world complex problem with a simplified format.


## Fundamental Questions

How can we improve the actual traffic situation on the Gotthard pass?
	-How can we model such a system?
	-How can we simulate traffic congestion?
	-Which parameters influence actual traffic?
	-Which parameters do we have to consider?
	-How can we simplify an existing dataset?


## Expected Results

We hope to find the important parameters the characterise traffic and try to implement this model with Matlab. In the best of hypothesis we hope to find a model to help improve traffic congestions.

A possible extension to the current model is that we can add different vehicle datasets and most importantly we have to change the number of lanes from two to one for both directions. 


## Research Methods

(Cellular Automata, Agent-Based Model, Continuous Modeling...) (If you are not sure here: 1. Consult your colleagues, 2. ask the teachers, 3. remember that you can change it afterwards)
